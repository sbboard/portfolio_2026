        there is a footer here mainly because i thought it would look cool. there's no actual useful
        information in this section of the site. it's here for purely aesthetic reasons. I'll even
        throw in some symbols so it looks even cooler. Watch this: ★ ☆ ✪ ✫ ✬ ✭ ✮ ✯ Doesn't it look
        cool from an aesthetic perspective? Look without digesting the content, just looking at it.
        // It looks cool. Text looks cool. // Information looks cool. Long words look cool.
