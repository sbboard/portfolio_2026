<template>
    <footer>
        I don't actually have anything to say in this footer. The only real reason this footer
        exists is because I thought a footer with some small text at the bottom of the page would
        look cool. I guess not everything that exists needs to carry responsibility. Some things are
        allowed to exist simply because they add texture, balance, and a sense of completion. This
        footer is here to give the page a quiet moment after the main content, a place where the
        design can breathe before everything fades out. And honestly, that feels like a pretty good
        job for a footer.

<style lang="scss" scoped>
footer {
    font-size: 0.6em;
    text-align: right;

    @media (max-width: 800px) {
        font-size: 5px;
    }
}
</style>
