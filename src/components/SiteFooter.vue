    <footer>
        I don't actually have anything meaningful, useful, or even particularly interesting to say
        in this footer. To be completely honest, the only real reason this exists at all is because
        I thought a footer with some small text at the bottom of the page would look kind of cool.
        There's no important information here, no hidden message, no fine print, and no legal
        disclaimer. But that's sort of the point - not everything on a page has to carry
        responsibility. Some things are allowed to exist simply because they add texture, balance,
        and a sense of completion. This footer is here to give the page a gentle landing, a quiet
        moment after the main content, a place where the design can breathe before everything fades
        out. If I wanted to, I guess I could put something special here. Maybe a tiny easter egg or
        something. Maybe the first breadcrumb of an ARG for all you heavy readers out there who
        always scroll just a little bit farther than most people do. But for now, it's just text -
        comfortable, unbothered, doing what footers have always done: anchoring the page, adding a
        little personality, and reminding you that someone thought about the space all the way down
        here too. And honestly, that feels like a pretty good job for a footer.
